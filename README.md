### What I learned

I learned how to write clean and efficient JavsScript code when it comes to the calculator functions. I liked how I used switch and case to assign the +, -, *, and / functions for the calculator to work.

### Continued development

I would have liked to add media queries to this.

### Useful resources

- [Statements & Switch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/switch) - This helped me figure out how to use case and switch with the basic algorithmic function in the calcualator. 
- [Calculator JS Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j59qQ7YWLxw&t=509s) - This is an amazing tutorial video that helped me figure out some of the functionalities for the calculator to work and display some of the numbers correctly.
